# Roadmap

Locus was built in twelve incremental milestones, each one shippable and verified against the real
`redis-cli` before moving on. The git history has one commit per milestone.

## Built (M0 → M12)

| # | Milestone |
|---|---|
| M0 | TCP server that replies `PONG` |
| M1 | Resumable RESP parser + `PING`/`ECHO`/`SET`/`GET` |
| M2 | Concurrency: thread-per-connection + single keyspace owner; more string commands |
| M3 | Key expiry — passive (on access) + active (background sampling) |
| M4 | Typed values — lists, hashes, sets (+ `WRONGTYPE`) |
| M5 | Sorted sets |
| M6 | RDB-style snapshot persistence |
| M7 | AOF (append-only file) + crash recovery |
| M8 | Pub/Sub (+ the async connection model) |
| M9 | Replication — full sync + command streaming |
| M10 | Transactions — `MULTI`/`EXEC`/`WATCH` |
| M11 | Streams — `XADD`/`XRANGE`/`XREAD` + blocking |
| M12 | RESP3 (`HELLO`), pipelining, benchmarking |

## Built — beyond the core (the differentiator layer)

On top of M0–M12, the reactive + geo-first vision is now implemented:

| Area | What |
|---|---|
| Hardening | TTL-overflow fix, transaction correctness (EXECABORT, WATCH-on-expiry, no-op-WATCH), `maxmemory` + eviction, parser DoS bounds, single command table |
| Command coverage | strings, keyspace, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, random — a broad Redis-compatible surface |
| **Changefeed** | `CDCSUBSCRIBE` (snapshot + live, no gap/dup), offsets + `CDCREAD` catch-up, consumer groups |
| **Geo** | `GEOSET`/`GEOPOS`/`GEODIST`/`GEOSEARCH` + **live geofencing** (`CDCSUBSCRIBE REGION`) |
| **Sketches** | Bloom, Count-Min, Top-K, t-digest |
| **CAS verbs** | `CAS`/`CADEL`/`SETMAX`/`INCRCAP` |
| **Secondary index** | `IDXCREATE`/`IDXGET`/`IDXRANGE` — query by field, auto-maintained |

See [CHANGEFEED.md](CHANGEFEED.md), [GEO.md](GEO.md), [SKETCHES.md](SKETCHES.md).

## Deferred (known, intentional)

- Replication's deep tail: **PSYNC partial resync**, replication backlog, `WAIT`, automatic **failover**
- A **skiplist** for O(log n) sorted-set rank/range (currently correct sort-on-demand)
- **AUTH / ACL / TLS**; multiple logical DBs (only DB 0)
- **Full RESP3 typing** of every reply (we negotiate `HELLO` but keep RESP2-compatible encoders)
- **Thread-per-core** execution for multi-core throughput

## Next major arc — geo phase 3 & clustering

- A real **S2-cell / R-tree** spatial index (sub-linear `GEOSEARCH`) with **combined attribute filters**
  (`nearby AND status=…`) and keyset pagination.
- **Spatial clustering** — horizontal sharding that preserves locality — the empty market intersection
  (in-memory · geo-first · clustered) that even Tile38 leaves open.
- Adopt-later primitives: per-element TTL, per-command durability, time-based changefeed retention.
